# Autonomous Resume Screening Project

This project implements an **Autonomous Resume Screening System** that automates the process of matching resumes to job descriptions using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning** models. The system is designed to help recruiters efficiently screen and prioritize candidates who best fit the requirements of a given job description.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an automated solution for comparing resumes with job descriptions, reducing the time and effort required by recruiters to manually review each resume. The system uses **BERT embeddings** to capture the semantic meaning of both resumes and job descriptions, and then applies **Cosine Similarity** to rank candidates based on how well their resumes match the job requirements.

### Features

- **BERT Embeddings**: The system leverages **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** to convert both resumes and job descriptions into vector representations. BERT allows the model to capture the context and meaning of the text, making the comparisons more accurate.
  
- **Cosine Similarity**: After obtaining the BERT embeddings, the system uses **Cosine Similarity** to measure the similarity between each resume and job description. This similarity score is used to rank resumes according to their relevance to the job.

- **Automated Ranking**: The resumes are automatically ranked based on their similarity scores to the job description, enabling recruiters to focus on the most relevant candidates.

### Data

The resume and job description dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [Kaggle](#). After preprocessing, the resumes and job descriptions are converted into numerical vectors using BERT embeddings, which capture the semantic meaning of the text.

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resumes and job descriptions were cleaned and tokenized (removing stopwords, lowercasing, etc.).
   
2. **Embedding Generation with BERT**:
   - BERT was used to generate embeddings for both the resumes and job descriptions, allowing the system to understand the contextual meaning of each document.

3. **Cosine Similarity for Comparison**:
   - Cosine Similarity was used to compare the embeddings of resumes with job descriptions, producing similarity scores between 0 and 1. A higher score indicates a closer match.

4. Merging
   - Resumes were merged with the job descriptions based on their similarity scores. The final dataset includes the resumes, job descriptions, and their corresponding similarity scores.

5. **Output**:
   - The system ranks candidates based on their similarity scores, with the highest scores representing the best matches for the job description.

### Future Improvements

- Integration of additional machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **Neural Networks** to classify candidates based on skills, qualifications, and experience.
- Further enhancement of the ranking system by incorporating factors like work experience, education, and skills.

### Conclusion

This project presents an automated approach to resume screening using advanced NLP and machine learning techniques. By leveraging BERT embeddings and Cosine Similarity, the system efficiently ranks resumes according to their relevance to specific job descriptions, making the recruitment process faster and more effective.
